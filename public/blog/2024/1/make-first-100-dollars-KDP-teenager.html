        <h2>How to make your first $100 on KDP as a teenager</h2>

        <p>Hello there, KDP publishing noobs,</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1000x300" alt="kdp puzzle book creator">
            <figcaption>Super Nice Photo</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <div class="tip tip-right">
            <p>This is a how to article by
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH2NZF1M">Saffron</a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>I have been in the <a href="/blog/2024/1/puzzle-book-author-interview.html" target="_blank">KDP puzzle book
                self publishing</a> game for a while now and something that I’ve noticed is
            that it takes a
            very long time to create certain types of low and medium content books.</p>
        <p> They are also the most profitable type of book for people who aren’t talented writers or artists.</p>
        <p>I always thought that fleshing out an idea for a should be easy and inexpensive; one should be able to throw
            out a product in the shortest time possible and with the least financial investment to see if said idea is
            viable.</p>

        <p> This is why I created an amazon ebook puzzle book creation tool aptly named <a href="/#manual"
                target="_blank">puzzle book creator</a></p>

        <p> With this tool, you’ll be able to create all the puzzlebooks you want in just minutes. The 5 dollars you’ll
            spend on a full manuscript is nothing compared to the the time and money you’ll save</p>

        <h3>what problems it solves</h3>
        <p> If you have tried creating a puzzle book from scratch you’ll know the following:</p>

        <p> <i>it is repetitive and mind mumbling.</i> The process entails looking for an online puzzle website that
            will let you download puzzle images for free and download one image after another. I have yet to find one
            that gives you unique puzzles in bulk in an image format that you can easily use commercially.</p>

        <p> <i>it is time consuming</i>. After downloading the images, you have to look for a PDF editing tool that will
            allow you to create PDFs from your puzzle images. The process of looking for one, learning how to use it and
            actually generating a PDF you are comfortable usually takes many hours to days.</p>

        <p> <i>It can be expensive.</i> The online puzzle websites and PDF editing tools are usually not free. That
            means that you may have to pay for them which ads to the cost of creating a puzzle book.</p>

        <p> <i>KDP formatting issues:</i> Amazon KDP has strict formatting rules for ebooks; each size of eBook will
            have different margin, bleed, font requirements. It can be very frustrating getting a puzzle book to get
            approval in this step.</p>

        <p>My puzzle book creator solves the above problems by allowing you to create puzzle books in a few minutes.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> These books are perfectly formatted for KDP meaning that instead of spending days creating a puzzle book,
            you can have one in a few minutes.</p>

        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>All you have to do is create a <a href="/" target="_blank">puzzle book creator</a>. You will then the ushered
            to the dashboard that you can either
            create</p>
        <ol type="1">

            <li>a puzzle book with a single type of puzzle or</li>
            <li>an assorted puzzle book from a list of over 20 puzzle types</li>

        </ol>


        <p>To create a puzzle book with a single type of puzzle:</p>
        <ol type="1">

            <li>click on the puzzle type you want e.g <a
                    href="/blog/2024/1/word-search-puzzle-books-puzzle-book-creator-publish-sell-KDP-tips-tricks.html"
                    target="_blank">word search</a></li>
            <li>enter the details of the puzzle book you want</li>
            <li>click generate and wait</li>

        </ol>

        <p>To create a puzzle book with a many types of puzzles:</p>
        <ol type="1">

            <li>click the check marks on on the puzzles type you want from the whole list e.g <a
                    href="/blog/2024/1/shingoki-puzzles-solve-tips-creating-publishing-selling-KDP-platform.html"
                    target="_blank">shingoki, nonogram and crossword</a></li>
            <li>click on the GREEN floating button on the bottom right hand corner</li>
            <li>enter the details of the puzzle book you want</li>
            <li>click generate and wait</li>

        </ol>

        <p><b>DO NOT CLOSE THE TAB AS THE GENERATION IS GOING ON</b></p>

        <p>NB: if you generate a manuscript and it either take too long or it errors out, just regenerate. Errors I have
            encountered during development have to do with the hosting provider I am using. This app by a solo developer
            is still in beta for some technical issues are to be expected.</p>

        <p>I created this <a href="/#manual" target="_blank">KDP puzzle book creator tool</a> especially for people who
            want to create an alternative source of income and do not have
            advanced technical skills or big money to start.</p>

        <p>Any questions, suggestions or criticisms are welcome</p>
