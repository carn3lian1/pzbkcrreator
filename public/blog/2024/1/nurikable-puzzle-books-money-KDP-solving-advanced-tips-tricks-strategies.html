        <h3>how to solve nurikabe puzzles</h3>
        <p>Nurikabe puzzles are an engaging form of logic puzzle that requires careful consideration of the grid to
            reveal a hidden pattern. Here's a detailed description of how to work through any <a

        </p>
        <p>Objective: The goal of a Nurikabe puzzle is to paint some cells black and leave the remaining cells white,
            adhering to the following rules:</p>
        <ol type="1">

            <li>Black cells form islands, each consisting of connected horizontally or vertically adjacent cells.</li>
            <li>The number inside a white cell indicates the size of the island it belongs to.</li>
            <li>Islands cannot touch each other horizontally or vertically.</li>
            <li>The white cells must all be connected horizontally or vertically, forming a continuous white region.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Guide:</h3>
        <ol type="1">

            <li><i>Start with the Clues:</i> Begin by examining the numerical clues given in the puzzle. These numbers
                represent the size of the islands and serve as a guide for where to start.</li>
            <li><i>Isolate Smallest Islands:</i> Identify the smallest numbers in the puzzle. These often lead to
                clearer deductions as they have fewer possibilities for placement. Mark the corresponding cells as part
                of the island.</li>
            <li><i>Use Elimination:</i> Use logic to eliminate possibilities. If a white cell cannot accommodate an
                island of the specified size while adhering to the rules, mark it black. Similarly, if a black cell
                would isolate an island or violate the size constraint, mark it white.</li>
            <li><i>Leverage the Grid Borders:</i> Pay attention to the grid borders. If a clue is close to an edge, it
                limits the possible direction of the island. Adjust your markings accordingly.</li>
            <li><i>Avoid Isolation:</i> Ensure that islands are not isolated and that the white cells form a connected
                region. If you encounter isolated islands or disconnected white cells, reevaluate your markings.</li>
            <li><i>Consider Patterns:</i> Nurikabe puzzles often exhibit repetitive patterns. Recognize common shapes
                and configurations to accelerate your solving process.</li>
            <li><i>Trial and Error:</i> In challenging situations, you may need to make temporary assumptions and
                evaluate their consequences. If a choice leads to a contradiction, backtrack and try an alternative.
            </li>
            <li><i>Iterate and Refine:</i> Continue iterating through steps 2-7, gradually refining your markings and
                uncovering more information about the puzzle's solution.</li>
            <li><i>Completion:</i> As you make logical deductions, the puzzle will start to unveil itself. Carefully
                apply the rules until you have successfully painted the correct cells, satisfying all constraints.</li>
        </ol>


        <p>By following these steps and employing a mix of deduction, elimination, and pattern recognition, you can
            successfully solve Nurikabe puzzles. Practice and experience will enhance your skills in tackling
            increasingly complex challenges.</p>

        <p>Objective: The goal of a Nurikabe puzzle is to shade (or paint) some cells black while leaving others white,
            following specific rules that ensure a coherent solution.</p>
        <h5>Rules:</h5>
        <h6>1. Islands:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li> The black-shaded cells form "islands," each consisting of horizontally or vertically adjacent cells.
            </li>
            <li> Islands cannot include any 2x2 square (four black cells forming a square).</li>

        </ul>
        <h6>2. Numbers:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li> The white cells contain numbers, indicating the size of the island to which they belong.</li>
            <li> The number represents the count of contiguous white cells forming the island.</li>

        </ul>
        <h6>3. Island Separation:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li> Islands must be separated by at least one white cell horizontally or vertically.</li>
            <li> No black cell should touch another black cell diagonally.</li>

        </ul>
        <h6>4. Continuous White Region:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li> All white cells must be connected horizontally or vertically, forming a single continuous region.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>detailed explanations of advanced strategies for solving nurikabe puzzles</h3>

        <p>Here are detailed explanations of advanced strategies for solving Nurikabe puzzles:</p>
        <p><b>1. Constraint Analysis: </b> Examine how the placement of black cells affects the constraints imposed by
            the numbers in the puzzle. Consider the impact on neighboring cells and how deductions in one area can
            influence decisions in another.</p>
        <p><b>2. Border Considerations: </b> Numbers near the edge of the puzzle have fewer available cells for
            expansion. Analyze how these numbers interact with the borders, as this can limit the possible
            configurations.</p>
        <p><b>3. Counting Spaces:</b> Counting the available spaces around a number helps to determine possible
            placements. For example, if a number is close to an edge, it may have restricted options for extending its
            island.</p>
        <p><b>4. Forcing Moves:</b> Identify cells that, if shaded or left empty, would force the puzzle into an
            unsolvable state. Conversely, look for cells that must be shaded to prevent an unsolvable state. This
            involves considering the consequences of each move.</p>
        <p><b>5. Critical Black Cells: </b> Recognize black cells that, when placed, dictate the arrangement of
            surrounding white cells. Understanding these critical placements is essential, especially when dealing with
            larger islands.</p>
        <p><b>6. Island Size Exclusion:</b> Examine larger islands and deduce where smaller islands cannot exist within
            them. This provides constraints on possible configurations and helps refine the placement of black and white
            cells.</p>
        <p><b>7. Empty Space Awareness:</b> Be mindful of large empty spaces in the puzzle. These areas often require
            careful consideration to ensure that islands can be properly filled while adhering to the puzzle rules.</p>
        <p><b>8. Parallel Analysis:</b> Analyze parallel paths of white cells running alongside each other.
            Understanding how these paths interact with islands can reveal deductions about the placement of black and
            white cells.</p>
        <p><b>9. Symmetry and Pattern Recognition: </b> Nurikabe puzzles often exhibit symmetry. Recognize and utilize
            patterns, especially those related to symmetry, to make deductions. Identifying repeating structures can
            guide your decision-making process.</p>
        <p><b>10. Inaccessible Cells:</b> Identify cells that become inaccessible if shaded. If shading a particular
            cell would isolate a part of the puzzle, it's likely an incorrect move. This strategy helps avoid creating
            unreachable areas.</p>
        <p><b>11. Multiple Solutions Consideration:</b> Be aware that some Nurikabe puzzles may have multiple valid
            solutions. However, strive to find a unique solution based on the given clues. Consider the implications of
            each move to minimize ambiguity.</p>
        <p>Applying these advanced strategies requires a combination of logical reasoning, visualization, and pattern
            recognition. As you practice, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how to navigate complex Nurikabe
            puzzles efficiently.</p>
