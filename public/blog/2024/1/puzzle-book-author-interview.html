        <p>Interviewer: Good day, readers! Today, we have the pleasure of sitting down with the highly successful
            <a href="/blog/2024/1/sudoku-puzzle-book-creator-publish-sell-KDP-tips-tricks-strategies-beginner-advanced-players.html"
                target="_blank">KDP puzzle book</a> author, Matt Turner. Matt, thank you for joining us.
        </p>
        <p>Matt: Thank you for having me. It's great to be here.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Let's dive right in. Can you tell us about your journey into the world of puzzlebook
            creation?</p>
        <p>Matt: Absolutely. It all began as a passion project. I've always been fascinated by puzzles, and it
            dawned on me that there was an opportunity to share that love with others. So, I started creating
            <a href="/blog/2024/1/reverse-word-search-puzzles-KDP-puzzle-book-creator-strategies-beginners-advanced-players.html"
                target="_blank">printable logic and word based KDP puzzlebooks</a> for myself and my friends. The
            response was fantastic, and
            that's when I realized I might be
            onto something bigger.
        </p>
        <p>Interviewer: That's fantastic! What led you to choose KDP as your platform for publishing?</p>
        <p>Matt: Well, <a href="/blog/2024/1/kakuro-puzzle-book-creator-play-rules-strategies-KDP-create-publish.html"
                target="_blank">KDP, or Kindle Direct Publishing for adult puzzle books</a>, just made sense. The ease
            of self-publishing, the global
            reach, and the ability to connect directly with my audienceâ€”those were the factors that drew me in. KDP
            allowed me to turn my passion into a business.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Can you share some insights into the creative process of developing a puzzlebook?</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"the unstoppable matching of time that is slowly guiding as all towards an inevitable death"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Matt: Certainly. It all starts with a theme. Whether it's a classic crossword book, a challenging
            Sudoku collection, or a mix of various puzzles, having a theme helps create a cohesive and engaging
            experience. From there, it's about designing puzzles that gradually increase in difficulty, ensuring that
            solvers feel a sense of accomplishment as they progress.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Interesting. So, what sets your puzzlebooks apart from others in the market?</p>
        <p>Matt: I believe it's the personal touch. I take the time to understand what my audience enjoys. I
            engage with them through social media, gather feedback, and incorporate that into my future projects. It's
            about building a community around the puzzles.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Building a community sounds wonderful. How do you go about marketing your puzzlebooks?
        </p>
        <p>Matt: Social media is a powerful tool. Platforms like Instagram and Facebook allow me to showcase
            snippets of puzzles, interact with my audience, and run promotions. Word of mouth is also significant. Happy
            solvers recommending my books to their friends has been a driving force in the success of my puzzlebooks. I
            also
            was using the <a href="/blog/2023/12/how-to-create-puzzle-books.html" target="_blank">online puzzle book
                creator tool</a> heavily. I credit it for saving me a lot of time and money in
            the
            actual puzzle book creation process
        </p>
        <p>Interviewer: Impressive. Now, for aspiring puzzlebook authors out there, any advice you'd like to
            share?</p>

            <figcaption>Sweet success on KDP</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Matt: Absolutely. First and foremost, be passionate about what you create. If you love your puzzles,
            chances are others will too. Don't be afraid to experiment with different puzzle types and themes. And most
            importantly, listen to your audience. They'll guide you in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Thank you, Matt. It's been a pleasure gaining insights into your journey. Any upcoming
            projects or surprises for your readers?</p>
        <p>Matt: I'm currently working on a collaborative project with a talented illustrator to bring a visually
            stunning puzzlebook to life. It's something new and exciting, and I can't wait to share it with everyone!
        </p>
        <p>Interviewer: That sounds intriguing. We'll be on the lookout for that. Thank you again, Matt, for
            sharing your story with us.</p>
        <p>Matt: Thank you. It's been a pleasure.</p>
