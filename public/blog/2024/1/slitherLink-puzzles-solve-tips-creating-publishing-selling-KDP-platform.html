        <p>SlitherLink puzzles are captivating logic puzzles that involve connecting dots in a grid to form a single

        <h3> Rules of slitherLink puzzles:</h3>
        <p>The goal of SlitherLink is to form a single, continuous loop by connecting dots in a rectangular grid. The
            loop must not intersect or branch off in multiple directions. Other rules players must abide my include:</p>
        <h4>1. Grid Structure:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> SlitherLink puzzles are played on a rectangular grid.</li>
            <li> Dots are placed at the intersections of grid lines.</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>2. Number Clues:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Numbers are placed within the grid, either inside or outside it.</li>
            <li> These numbers indicate how many sides of the square they are in should be part of the loop.</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>3. Connecting the Dots:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Your task is to connect adjacent dots with horizontal or vertical lines to create a single continuous
                loop.</li>
            <h4>4. Number Constraints:</h4>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Follow the number clues to determine how many sides of a square should be connected.</li>
            <li> A "0" means none of the sides are connected.</li>
            <li> A "4" means all four sides are connected.</li>
            <li> A "1," "2," or "3" indicates the corresponding number of sides to connect.</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>5. Borders and Loop Completeness:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The loop should not cross itself, and there should be only one continuous loop in the grid.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to squares along the grid's border; they have fewer adjacent sides to connect.</li>

        </ul>
        <h5>Example:</h5>
        <p> If a square has a "2" clue, it means two sides of that square should be connected to form the loop.</p>
        <p> If a side already has a connection, you can deduce the direction of the loop for the remaining sides.</p>

        <h3>How to solve any slitherLink puzzle</h3>

        <h5>1. Start with Clues:</h5>
        <p> Look for clues provided by the numbers in the grid. A "0" means there are no segments around that square,
            while a "4" means all sides have segments.</p>
        <h5>3. Use Borders:</h5>
        <p> Work from the edges inward. If a side is not explicitly indicated to have a segment, it should remain
            blank.</p>
        <h5>4. Avoid Isolation:</h5>
        <p> Make sure every square with a number is connected to the loop. Isolated squares can't have the indicated
            number of segments.</p>
        <h5>5. Corner Strategies:</h5>
        <p> Corners are crucial. A corner with a "0" must remain empty, while a corner with a "4" must have all sides
            filled.</p>
        <h5>6. Elimination:</h5>
        <p> Use the process of elimination. If a side is filled on one square, it might affect the possibilities for
            neighboring squares.</p>
        <h5>7. Trial and Error:</h5>
        <p> Sometimes, you may need to try out different configurations to see if they lead to a solution. If you
            encounter contradictions, reassess your approach.</p>
        <h5>8. Loop Completion:</h5>
        <p>Once you have connected all the dots and formed a single continuous loop, the puzzle is solved.</p>
        <h3>Tips and Tricks:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Look for areas where the loop must pass through, especially around corners and borders.</li>
            <li> Be mindful of squares with "2" or "3" clues, as they often have only one valid configuration.</li>
            <li> Use markings to indicate potential segments or empty sides.</li>

        </ul>
        <p> Example: Let's say you have a "2" clue. This means two sides of that square have segments. If one side is
            already connected, you can deduce the direction of the loop for the remaining side.</p>
