        <p>Alright, check it out! If you're thinking of diving into the world of puzzle book creation, there's this
            sweet tool called the <a href="/" target="_blank">puzzle book creator</a> that's got your back. It lets you
            choose from different types of
            puzzle books, and you can go all-in on one type or mix it up with as many as you fancy.</p>
        <p>Here's the lowdown:</p>

        <p>First things first, create a free account. Once you're in, you'll land on the dashboard where you get to
            decide if you wanna:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Make a puzzle book with just one type of puzzle, or</li>
            <li>Go wild and create an assorted puzzle book from a list that's got over 10 puzzle types.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're feeling the single-type vibe:</p>
        <ol type="1">


            <li>Hit up the puzzle type you're into.</li>
            <li>Pop in the details of your puzzle book.</li>
            <li>Smash that generate button and chill while the magic happens.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>If you're up for a mixed bag:</p>

        <ol type="1">

            <li>Tick the boxes for the puzzle types you're vibing with from the whole list.</li>
            <li>Spot that GREEN floating button down at the bottom right.</li>
            <li>Toss in the deets of your puzzle book.</li>
            <li>Hit generate and let the tool do its thing.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Important note: DON'T go closing that tab while the generation is in full swing.</p>
        <p>Quick tip: If you hit any snags during the process, like it's taking too long or gives you an error, just hit
            that regenerate button. Sometimes tech gremlins mess around, especially since this app is still in beta.</p>
        <p>Oh, and here's the backstory—I whipped up this tool for folks who are keen on scoring some extra cash without
            needing crazy tech skills or a fat wallet.</p>
