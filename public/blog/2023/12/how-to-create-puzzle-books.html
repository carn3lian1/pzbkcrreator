        <p>To All KDP publishers around the world!!!</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly, the accessible entry point to Amazon KDP, particularly in the realm of puzzle books like
            crossword,
            word search, <a href="/blog/2024/1/KDP-etsy-printable-maze-puzzle-book-creator.html"
                target="_blank">maze</a> etc. has led to a saturation of products. With economic challenges on the
            horizon and
            escalating competition, standing out may appear more challenging.</p>

        <p>To enhance your prospects, there are two approaches:</p>
        <ol type="a">


            <li>transitioning to long-form books or </li>
            <li>opting for highly niched down puzzle books</li>

        </ol>
        <p>In this discussion, we'll hone in on the latter—an expansion for no-content book publishers that doesn't
            necessitate a significant leap into the realm of novels or non-fiction books. Enter the unassuming puzzle
            book. </p>

        <p>Surprisingly easy to create, and with the identification of a properly underserved niche (of which we'll
            provide plenty), you can achieve consistent sales.</p>
