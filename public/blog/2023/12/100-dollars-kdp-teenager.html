        <h2>How to make your first $100 on KDP as a teenager!</h2>

        <p>Whassuup,</p>

        <p>I have been in the KDP self publishing game for a while now and something that I’ve noticed is that it takes
            a very long time to create certain types of low and medium content books.
            They are also the most profitable type of book for people who aren’t talented writers or artists.
            I always thought that fleshing out an idea for a should be easy and inexpensive; one should be able to throw
            out a product in the shortest time possible and with the least financial investment to see if said idea is
            viable.</p>

        <div class="tip tip-right">
            <p>This is a how to article by
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH2NZF1M">Saffron</a>
            </p>
        </div>


        <p>This is why I created an <a href="/#manual" target="_blank">amazon ebook puzzle book creation tool</a> aptly
            named puzzle book creator</p>

        <blockquote>

        <h2>what problems it solves</h2>
        <p>
            If you have tried creating a puzzle book from scratch you’ll know the following:

            <i>it is repetitive and mind mumbling.</i> The process entails looking for an online puzzle website that
            will let
            you download puzzle images for free and download one image after another. I have yet to find one that gives
            you unique puzzles in bulk in an image format that you can easily use commercially.
        </p>

        </figure>


        <p><i>it is time consuming.</i> After downloading the images, you have to look for a PDF editing tool that will
            allow
            you to create PDFs from your puzzle images. The process of looking for one, learning how to use it and
            actually generating a PDF you are comfortable usually takes many hours to days.
        </p>

        <p><i>It can be expensive.</i>
             The online puzzle websites and PDF editing tools are usually not free. That means that
            you may have to pay for them which ads to the cost of creating a puzzle book.
        </p>

                manuscript from puzzle book creator.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><i>KDP formatting issues:</i> Amazon KDP has strict formatting rules for ebooks; each size of
            eBook will have different margin, bleed, font requirements. It can be very frustrating getting a puzzle book
            to get approval in this step.</p>

        <div class="tip tip-left">
            <p>You can watch a video tutorial right here:
                <a href="#">YouTube</a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>My puzzle book creator solves the above problems by allowing you to create puzzle books in a few minutes.</p>

        <p>These books are perfectly formatted for KDP meaning that instead of spending days creating a puzzle book, you
            can have one in a few minutes.</p>

        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>
            All you have to do is create a free account. You will then the ushered to the dashboard that you can either
            create</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>NB: if you generate a manuscript and it either take too long or it errors out, just regenerate. Errors I have
            encountered during development have to do with the hosting provider I am using. This app by a solo developer
            is still in beta for some technical issues are to be expected.</p>

        <p>I created this tool especially for people who want to create an <a
                href="/blog/2024/1/student-5000-puzzle-books-journey.html" target="_blank">alternative source of
                income</a> and do not have
            advanced technical skills or big money to start.</p>
